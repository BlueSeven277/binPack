1.Class Bin is used to define the structure of the bins
2.For the other classes, each class implement one algorithm, BestFit contains the naive BF and
our improved algorithm BFP
3.How to run?
  Run the main function of each class.
  The current test case is case 3. Test case 1 and case 2 are commented. Uncomment the code if you want to test them.
  The output is the number of bins needed to pack the given boxes. Runtime is also printed.
